# SIMEON-ARIFUL REPO

## Steps on how to solve microverse coding challenges

### MICROVERSE JAVASCRIPT CHALLENGE PRACTICE

- In this warm up, you and your coding partner will work together to solve two JavaScript coding challenges. One person will start as the Driver üöò and the other as the Navigator üß≠. Once you finish the first challenge, you will switch roles.

- Decide who will start as Driver and who will be the Navigator.
- The person that will start as the Driver should start a Zoom.us video call (if you aren't already on a call), invite the other person, and share their screen.
- Then the current Driver will click here to get two challenges assigned\* (each one of you will solve one of the challenges).

### MICROVERSE HMTL/CSS CHALLENGE PRACTICE

- Let's get started with the HTML/CSS project!
  During this first step, you will initialize the repository for your web project and practice pair programming with GitHub .

- Make sure you have both installed Visual Studio Code editor or Atom editor
- Create a new Github repository
- Share the repository with your coding partner on Github (help)
- Use Git to check out the project in your computer (help)
- Download this repository from Github (do not fork it) and its files to your repository.
- Add the text ‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù inside the body of the index.html file and save it
- Open the file in web browser and see the result
- Commit and push your changes to the Github repo
- Switch roles and make sure the new driver is the one screen sharing now.
- Fetch the updated repository in the computer of the new driver
- Modify index file so it says ‚ÄúHello World, we are software developers!‚Äù and save it
- See the result in web browser
- Commit and push the changes
- and you are done
